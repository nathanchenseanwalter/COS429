# Use this script to run and test your edge detector. For each of the two
# provided sample images, it should create and write the following images
# to disk, using the best parameters (per image) you were able to find:
#
# 1) The smoothed horizontal and vertical gradients (2 images).
# 2) The gradient magnitude image.
# 3) The gradient magnitude image after suppression.
# 4) The results of your full edge detection function.
#
# The image naming convention isn't important- this script exists for you
# to test and experiment with your code, and to figure out what the best
# parameters are. As far as automated testing is concerned, only the
# five functions in canny.py must adhere to a specific interface. 

# TODO: Implement me!
